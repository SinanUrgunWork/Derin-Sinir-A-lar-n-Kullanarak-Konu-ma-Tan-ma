# Derin Evrişimli Sinir Ağları ile Ses Tanıma

## Proje Hakkında
This project aims to improve speech recognition capabilities using audio data collected from noisy environments. Based on the methods outlined in the study 'Speech Recognition using Convolutional Deep Neural Networks' by Ayad Alsobhani and his team, it demonstrates success in recognizing speech with a 97.06% accuracy rate using a CNN architecture.
